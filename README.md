# Mass-Editor
This program is a mass editor for every Pokémon file you can read or create with PKHeX, so that you don't have to do it for several Pokémon manually!

How to use it:
- You just drag and drop the folders or files that should be edited into the free space
- Click on the changes you want to apply and configure it as much as you want
- After you configured everything the way you want it, you just click the big "Mass Edit" button and your Pokémon have been edited
